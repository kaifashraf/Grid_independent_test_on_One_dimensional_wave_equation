# Grid_independent_test_on_One_dimensional_wave_equation
We have done  numerical calculations and provides a code for solving 1-D wave equation using the upwind-finite scheme. The objective is to analyze the grid independence of the numerical solution while changing Courant number(Î») and grid size (N).
